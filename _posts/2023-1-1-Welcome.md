Join hosts Josh Quick, Lauren Norby, and Daniel Mrgan, talented artists from Western Montana, as they explore, analyze, and occasionally praise these cinematic gems. The show delves into the essence of Montana's influence on these films, questioning whether their unique qualities could have emerged elsewhere. This series is a testament to Montana's ideal suitability for filmmaking, highlighting diverse genres from the quirky "Disorganized Crime" in Hamilton to the intense drama "Certain Women" in Livingston, and even iconic horror films like "The Shining" partially shot in Glacier Park. It's a celebration of how Montana's majestic environment contributes to the art of storytelling and Western myth-making.
